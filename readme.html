<center><h1>Airdash</h1></center><br>
<center>By GreenHammerBro</center><br>
<hr>
This simple uberasm tool code enables the player to perform airdash, a move inspired by some platforming games
that flings the player character horizontally straight for a short distant in the air.
<hr>
<h2>Insertion</h2>
Note: labels and defines here are case sesitive.
<ol>
<li>Edit the defines as necessary in <tt>AirDash.asm</tt>.</li>
<li>Place <tt>AirDash.asm</tt> in any of these ways (pick one):</li>
<ul>
<li>All levels
<ol>
<li>in as <tt>Gamemode 14</tt> (in the <tt>gamemode</tt> folder) for all levels and in the <tt>list.txt</tt> file,
paste this text:
<table><tr><td><pre>gamemode:
; Insert files here
14		AirDash.asm</pre></td></tr></table></li>
<li>Paste whats in this package's <tt>routines</tt> folder into uberasm tool's equivalent <tt>library</tt> folder.</li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>Specific levels</li>
<ol>
<li>Paste <tt>AirDash.asm</tt> in <tt>library</tt>, then open that copy and change the label <tt>main:</tt>
to <tt>AirDashMain:</tt>.</li>
<li>Create level files that you want to use the airdash for and put them in the <tt>level</tt> folder in uberasm tool. Then simply call the
airdash code like this (this must run as <tt>main:</tt>):
<table><tr><td><pre>main:
	;...
	JSL AirDash_AirDashMain
	;...
	RTL</pre></td></tr></table>
Be sure to pay attention to the jumps and branches so that the game's handling does not unintentionally skip this, causing the airdash to not work, if you have
other codes in the same level file.
</li>
<li>Unfortunately at the time of making this, uberasm tool version 1.3 (11-22-2018) does not support a library routine file containing a <tt>JSL</tt> to
another library routine file, thus go to this package directory: <tt>routines/GenerateSmoke.asm</tt>, copy its entire code, and paste it <b>after the <tt>RTL</tt></b> so that
the main code does not end up accidentally executing this when it shouldn't. Then change <nobr><tt>JSL GenerateSmoke_Smoke</tt></nobr> to <nobr><tt>JSL Smoke</tt></nobr>
so that the routine call works with the in-file routine.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Now run the tool to insert the gimmick.</li>
</ol>

<h2>Combining with <a href="https://www.smwcentral.net/?p=section&a=details&id=14759">Airjump</a></h2>
Perhaps you want a gimmicky hack involving using a combination of airjumping and dashing in platforming levels.<br><br>

Note that this assumes you are using airjump version that was submitted at 01-03-2017, you may have to edit it should a newer version exist that you need to use.

To insert:
<ol>
<li>Depending on how you perfer &ldquo;All levels&rdquo; or &ldquo;Specific Levels&rdquo;:</li>
<ul>
<li>All levels:</li>
<ol>
<li>Remove the <tt>RTL</tt> at the bottom of <tt>AirDash.asm</tt> and paste the entire airjump code (everything, including defines) below it.</li>
</ol>
<li>Specific levels:</li>
<ol>
<li>Perhaps you want either of them enabled in levels individually, have your level file like this:
<table><tr><td><pre>main:
	;...
	JSL AirDash_AirDashMain ;\Make sure you have an RTL at the end of their codes.
	JSL Airjump_AirjumpMain ;/
	;...
</pre></td></tr></table></li>
<li>Move <tt>Airjump.asm</tt> to the <tt>library</tt> folder, edit the <tt>main:</tt> label to <tt>AirjumpMain:</tt>.</li>
</ol>
</ul>
<li>Edit the define <nobr><tt>!Freeram_JumpCountLeft</tt></nobr> to not use the same RAM address <nobr><tt>!Freeram_AirDashTime</tt></nobr> is using.</li>
<li>Edit this airjump code to prevent weirdness when the player airjumps during an airdash:
<table><tr><td><pre>	..BothJumps
	LDA #$0B			;\Jump pose (replaces long jump pose)
	STA $72				;/
	BRA ..Return			;>In case if you have code below.
</pre></td></tr></table>
changed to:
<table><tr><td><pre>	..BothJumps
	LDA #$0B			;\Jump pose (replaces long jump pose)
	STA $72				;/
	LDA.b #!Setting_AirDash_Cooldown	;\If player jumps while airdashing, cancel airdash
	CMP !Freeram_AirDashTime		;|but don't instant cooldown.
	BCS ..Return				;|
	STA !Freeram_AirDashTime		;/
	BRA ..Return			;>In case if you have code below.
</pre></td></tr></table>
Now keep in mind that this will cause <nobr><tt>!Freeram_AirDashTime</tt></nobr> to be written when <nobr><tt>!Freeram_AirDashTime</tt></nobr> is a value &ge; the
value <nobr><tt>!Setting_AirDash_Cooldown</tt></nobr> even when you're not using the airdash but using the airjump code. So while it is not used
by the airdash code, it is not recommended to re-use this RAM address when any of the two <tt>air&lt;perform move&gt;</tt> are in effect.
</li>
<li>Copy all the defines in <tt>AirDash.asm</tt> at the top and paste them in <tt>Airjump.asm</tt>. Make sure their settings matches up (up to date) if you change
any of them. This is due to uberasm tool's library defines gets &ldquo;forgotten&rdquo; when processing levels.</li>
